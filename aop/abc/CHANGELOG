# This file is parsed to produce changelog information in a variety
# of formats. Start new entries with a '$', and continuation lines 
# with a ';'. Normally lines denoting a new release are added automatically,
# but the format is "%<version number> <unixtime>" if you need 
# to make one of your own. Lines beginning with '#' are ignored, predictably
# enough. 
# 
# You should generally avoid changing the file below a line starting
# with '%', as this would alter the changelog for versions that are already
# released.
#
# If you mess around with the packaging for a specific distribution,
# add a line saying "^debian:" before the changelog entry (currently only
# debian and redhat are understood here, and we don't actually have a 
# redhat package).
# 
# If you want to change the name that is recorded as making a release,
# add a line in the form "&name of releaser <email@address>".
#
# The scripts that process this file are:
# dist/makechangelogs.pl - to generate various formats for it
# dist/addchangelogrelease.pl - to record a new release in the file, below
# these comments.
