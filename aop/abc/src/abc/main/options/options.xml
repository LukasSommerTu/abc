<options>
  <intro>
    <p>
You can write some introduction to the options document here
if you want. Use <tt>HTML</tt>-style tags if you need to.
Just be sure to close them and nest them properly.
    </p>
    <p>
The HTML-like stuff will be converted to the equivalent latex for you.
Hopefully, you won't have anything complicated.

  <section>
<!--
I think it's useful to organize the options into sections (for
readability. If that's too hard, just put them all into one section. You
can make up tags for things that you think are useful information. For
example, it might be useful to tag options which are the same as ajc
options with something like <ajc/>
-->
    <name>General Options</name>
    <!-- Give each section a name. The options in the section follow. -->
    <pathopt>
      <alias>sourceroots</alias>
<!--
In Soot, we found it useful to have both short documentation and long
documentation for each option. The short is a one-line thing used in
the usage screen. The long is used in the printed documentation.
If that's too much work, just do one of them.
-->
      <set_arg_label>path</set_arg_label>
      <short_desc>Use classes in dirs in <use_arg_label/> as source.</short_desc>
      <long_desc>
<use_arg_label/> should be a list of directories. Tells abc to compile all
.java files found in <use_arg_label/> and any of its subclasses.
      </long_desc>
<!--
For the set_arg_label/use_arg_label thing, you also don't have to do that
if you don't want to. We found it quite useful, because we set it in 
all caps in the usage screen, and in \em in latex. (for abc, in the usage
screen, we probably want to set it in angle brackets for consistency
with ajc)
The idea is that it will come up something like the following in the usage
screen:
  -sourceroots  <path>              Use classes in dirs in <path> as source.
-->
    </pathopt>
    <boolopt>
      <alias>h</alias>
      <alias>help</alias>
      <short_desc>foo</short_desc>
      <long_desc>
Prints the usage screen. Notice that there are two aliases, -h and -help, so
the XML file has two alias tags.
      </long_desc>
    </boolopt>
    <debugopt>
      <undocumented/>
<!--
The fact that this option is undocumented will probably just be
implied by the fact that it's a debugopt, but it may be nice to
specify it explicitly, so that we can later make other options
(non-debug) options undocumented if we wish.
-->
      <alias>ajcCompliance</alias>
      <default>false</default>
      <short_desc>foo</short_desc>
      <long_desc>
Makes abc bug-for-bug compatible with ajc.
      </long_desc>
    </debugopt>
<!--
If you think of things other than pathopt/debugopt/boolopt, just start
using them (as long as you use them consistently)
-->
  </section>
<!--
you can put more sections here
actually, it probably makes sense to put all the debug options in their
own section
-->
</options>
