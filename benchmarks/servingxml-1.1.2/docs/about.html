<P>My name is Daniel Parker.  I started an open source project called 
<A HREF="http://presentingxml.sourceforge.net/"> Presenting XML</A> in 
January 2001.  As it turned out, most people that used this tool were 
interested in, not the web application framework, for which there were more 
established alternatives, but rather the content transformation 
capabilities of the console app samples, particularly for 
transforming flat files to XML and vice versa. As a result of this observation, 
<A HREF="http://servingxml.sourceforge.net/"> Serving XML</A> came to be in 
December 2003.

<P>I have a company called Economic Technology, Inc.  
I do freelance consulting.  I can be reached at
