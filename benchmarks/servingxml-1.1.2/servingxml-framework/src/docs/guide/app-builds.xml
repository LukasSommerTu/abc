<title>Building ServingXML</title>
<para>
An ant build.xml file is located in the servingxml directory.  
To build the distribution jar file servingxml.jar, enter the command

<programlisting>
build
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The build.xml file defines three build targets:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
dist, the default, which builds the distribution jar file 
servingxml.jar in the lib directory.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
tests, which builds the test suite jar file 
tests.jar in the tests directory.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
javadoc, which builds the javadoc files 
in the docs/api directory.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
To specify a target, provide the target name as an argument to the build command,
e.g. to build the javadoc target, enter the command

<programlisting>
build javadoc
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The build requires the presence of certain third party jar files in the lib directory.  
These are described in a readme file in the lib directory.
