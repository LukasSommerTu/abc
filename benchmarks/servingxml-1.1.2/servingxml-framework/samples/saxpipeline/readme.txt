This example shows an implementation of the SAX Pipeline example in Michael Kay's 
XSLT Programmer's Reference book, Appendix F, Example 5.  


The batch file saxpipeline2xml.cmd uses the resources script resources.xml to
process the pipeline.

Running this example requires the following steps:  

- Run the sample build script at the command line, to compile
  the pre and post Java XMLFilter classes and copy them into 
  the distribution classes directory. 

- Enter the following command to produce the final HTML page

    pipeline2html
