  <h2>What is ServingXML?</h2>
  <p><b>ServingXML</b> is an open source, Apache 2.0 licensed, framework for flat/XML data transformations.
  It defines an extensible vocabulary for expressing flat-XML, XML-flat, flat-flat, and XML-XML processing 
  in pipelines.  
  <B>ServingXML</B> currently comes with a console app, and also 
    documents an API for <A HREF="embed.html">imbedding</A> 
    the software in a standard Java or J2EE application.
  </P>
<B>ServingXML</B> works as an <A HREF="servingxml-3.html">"inversion of control"</A>
container for assembling components 
from a variety of projects - Apache FOP, Sun MSV 
and others - and making them work together to process records and XML.
New elements may be added by implementing the contracts in the extension API's.
