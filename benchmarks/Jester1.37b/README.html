<tt>Copyright (2000-2005) <a href="http://www.tadmad.co.uk">Ivan Moore</a>.</tt>
<p>Jester finds code that is not covered by tests. Jester makes some
change to your code, runs your tests, and if the tests pass Jester
displays a message saying what it changed. </p>
<p>Jester includes a script for generating web pages that show the
changes made that did not cause the tests to fail. </p>
<p>Jester is different than code coverage tools, because it can find
code that is executed by the running of tests but not actually tested.
However, Jester is not meant as a replacement for code coverage tools,
merely as a complementary approach. </p>
<p>Jester is available only under the terms of the <a
 href="LICENSE.html">license agreement</a>. </p>
<p>Jester has been tried on various operating systems, using Sun's JDK
1.4.1 and JUnit 3.8.1. There is absolutely no warranty whatsoever (see <a
 href="LICENSE.html">license agreement</a> ); it might work on those or
other platforms - see the <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net">Jester
web page</a> for latest known bugs, platforms that it has been tried on,
FAQs, etc). Older versions of Jester might work with older versions of
Java/JUnit (e.g. Jester &lt; 1.30 for Java &lt; 1.4). </p>
<h2> Installation:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> unzip the jester.zip file (e.g. jester105.zip) in an empty
directory</li>
  <li> java (&gt;=1.4) must already be installed, with java and javac on
the path</li>
  <li> JUnit 3.8.1 must already be installed, and on the classpath
(Jester might also be compatable with other versions of JUnit)</li>
  <li> add jester to the classpath; '<tt>set
classpath=%classpath%;INSTALL_DIR\jester.jar'</tt> (Note - for windows
you can run the included batch file 'setcp' to set the classpath to
include Jester and JUnit for running the examples (test.bat and
acceptancetest.bat) and Jester's tests (runAllTests.bat) in the
installation directory.) </li>
  <li> for a simple example: run the batch file '<tt>test.bat'</tt>;<b>NOTE</b>,
the directory containing <tt>'test.bat' </tt>must also be on the
classpath.</li>
  <li> after less than 2 minutes, there should be the following text:</li>
</ul>
<tt>For File jester\functionaltests\NotTested.java: 1 mutations
survived out of 1 changes. Score = 0</tt><br>

(char index=146) from 1 to 2</tt><br>
<tt> Anything() {</tt><br>

<tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return &gt;&gt;&gt;1;</tt><br>
<tt> &nbsp;}</tt><br>
<tt> }</tt><br>
<tt> <br>

survived out of 1 changes. Score = 100</tt><br>
<tt> <br>
1 mutations survived out of 3 changes. Score = 67</tt><br>
<tt> took 0 minutes</tt>
<ul>
  <li> if the message above does not appear, see the FAQ referenced at
the end of this document.</li>
  <li> for a longer example, run 'acceptancetest.bat' (this <b>needs
JUnit &gt;= 3.7</b> to run); this should result in '... <tt>19
mutations survived out of 39 changes. Score = 52 ...'</tt> This example
also needs <b>Python &gt;= 2.0</b> installed and generates a file "<tt>jester.html</tt>"
which shows the changes Jester made that did not cause the tests to
fail.</li>
</ul>
Jester has a progress window - the progress bar shows the proportion of
source files that have been mutated; the text area shows the most
recent mutation that has been made; the progress bar is green if the
last mutation caused the tests to fail (i.e. good) and red if the tests
still passed despite the mutation (i.e. bad). Note that the progress
bar does not show progress while making different mutations to the same
file - that is shown by text in the text area changing - because that
was simpler to implement and the progress bar as it is gives a
reasonably accurate indication of the amount of progress that has been
made.
<h2> Usage:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Very IMPORTANT</b> - only run Jester on a <b>copy</b> of your
source files - as Jester changes the source code that it works on. If
you use source control (which everyone should!) then you can leave
your source code where it is (making sure everything you want to be in
source control is checked in) and overwrite all your source from source
control after running Jester. If you don't use source control, only run
Jester on a copy of your source in a different directory, otherwise
you'll regret it!</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>To run Jester, execute '<tt>java jester.TestTester TEST_CLASS
SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY</tt>' where <tt>TEST_CLASS </tt>is the name of the
JUnit test class <tt>(a subclass of TestCase </tt>that can be used by
the JUnit TestRunners<tt>) </tt>and <tt>SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY</tt> 
(or <tt>SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY1 SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY2 ...</tt> etc) are the (one or more)
directories (or source files) that contain the source code that
Jester changes to try to find if the tests are not covering those
changes (make sure that you have another copy of those source files as
Jester will change these files and might not restore them to their original if things go wrong).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The<tt> .class </tt>files needed to run your<tt> TEST_CLASS </tt>must
be in the <tt>SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY </tt>(<tt>SOURCE_FILE_OR_DIRECTORY </tt>must
be on the classpath)<tt>.</tt> <b>NOTE</b> that there are several
variants of specifying the classpath:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>You can have everything you need to run your tests on the
static classpath</li>
    <li>You can alter the command that Jester uses to run the tests as
described later</li>
    <li>You can specify the classpath Jester should use with the <tt>-cp</tt> option of Jester. Then you
execute '<tt>java jester.TestTester -cp=CLASSPATH TEST_CLASS
SOURCE_DIRECTORY</tt>' where CLASSPATH is the classpath needed by the
invoked java compiler and by the java vm to&nbsp; execute the tests.
This way is often the most suitable when you run Jester directly from
your IDE or ANT.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <li>
    <p><tt>TEST_CLASS </tt>should be the test class that is expected
to show up any changes to code in the <tt>SOURCE_DIRECTORY. </tt>Typically, <tt>TEST_CLASS</tt> would
be the TestAll class of a package, and<tt> SOURCE_DIRECTORY </tt>would
be the subdirectory that contains the code being tested by that<tt>
TEST_CLASS.</tt></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For any change that Jester was able to make without the tests
failing, it prints the name of the file changed, the position in the
file of the change (the character index), and some of the original
source file from roughly 30 characters before to 30 characters after so
that the change can be identified within the source file. Note that
Jester can take a long time to run - try it on a small part of your
system before trying it on everything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jester also produces a file called "<tt>jesterReport.xml</tt>"
that contains all the changes that Jester made that did not cause the
tests to fail. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute "<tt>python makeAllChangesFiles.py jesterReport.xml</tt>"
to generate copies of the original source files with all the changes
Jester made that did not cause the tests to fail. These files are in
the same directories, and have the same names, exept have a "<tt>.jester</tt>"
extension (configurable). These files are useful for comparing against
the original source code using whatever you usually use to compare
files, to easily find the changes Jester made that did not cause the
tests to fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Execute "<tt>python makeWebView.py</tt>" to generate copies of
the original source files as "<tt>.html</tt>" pages, with all the
changes Jester made that did not cause the tests to fail shown in red,
and the code it changed shown with a line through it. A file "<tt>jester.html</tt>"
is generated which links to all these files. These files are in the
same directories, and have the same names, as the original source
files, except have a "<tt>.html</tt>" extension. This script has
options:
    <ul>
      <li>-z to ignore files that Jester didn't make any changes to</li>
      <li>-p to ignore files that Jester didn't make any changes to
where the tests still passed</li>
      <li>-s to sort the files by file name in the "<tt>jester.html</tt>"
file.</li>
    </ul>
For other options, try "<tt>python makeWebView.py -h</tt>". </p></li>
<li><p>Jester prints out warnings when it can't find it's config files. In such circumstances, Jester uses default values which are OK in most cases.</p></li>
	<li><b>(New </b>small<b> feature)</b> You can specify that Jester should not show the progress dialog by using the "-q" command line argument.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Jester writes out a file "<tt>jesterTimeout.txt</tt>" (in the
directory where it is executed) whose contents is the number of
milliseconds the tests took to run the first time they were run (i.e.
before Jester made any changes). This is used by Jester to stop running
the tests if they are taking too long (e.g. in case a change made by
Jester causes the code to enter an infinite loop). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you kill Jester during a run, by CTRL-C, there is a risk that your source code will not be
reverted back to its original state and hence the tests might fail and
hence Jester will not be able to run against your code unless you
revert the effected file. This might be fixed in a future version, but
might not - Jester cannot be held responsible for messing up your
source code, it's up to you to look after it. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration options</h2>
For the following features, edit the file called "<tt>jester.cfg</tt>"
from the installation directory and make sure it is on the classpath.
For example, <tt>compilationCommand=javac</tt> refers to a line of text
in the <tt>jester.cfg</tt> file.
<ul>
  <li>Jester can use a different compiler, by setting <tt>compilationCommand</tt>
to whatever you want Jester to use. By default, this is set to <tt>compilationCommand=javac</tt>.</li>
  <li>If your compiler uses a different source file extension than <tt>.java</tt>
then set <tt>sourceFileExtension</tt> as appropriate. </li>
  <li>Jester can also be made to print the results as it goes rather
than waiting until it has finished to print an amalgamated report of
all the changes it has made per file, by setting <tt>shouldReportEagerly=true</tt>.
This can be useful if Jester is failing to complete it's run. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Configurable mutations</h2>
The mutations that Jester applies to the source code are configurable,
by editing the file "<tt>mutations.cfg</tt>" from the installation
directory, which must be on the classpath. Each line of this file must
have a format like: <br>
<tt>%if(%if(true ||</tt> where % can be any single
character as a delimiter, and the text <tt>if(</tt> will be replaced by <tt>if(true
||</tt>.
Note that this
simple scheme of replacing text without parsing has proven adequate so
far, but is likely to change in a future version of Jester.
<h2>Configurable Ignore List (e.g. for ignoring comments)</h2>
Jester can be made to ignore parts of every source file, by using the <tt>ignorelist.cfg</tt>
file. This file contains lines starting with a delimiter character that
specify regions of the source code to ignore; i.e. regions where it
will not try to make a mutation. The first string is where to start
ignoring the source and the second is where to stop ignoring the
source. For example, to ignore comments in Java code, the <tt>ignorelist.cfg</tt>
file would contain:
<pre>%/*%*/<br>%//%\n<br></pre>
(this is not entirely correct but is close enough; e.g. a string
"http://jester.sf.net" up to the end of the line would not be
considered for mutation by Jester using this <tt>ignorelist.cfg</tt>
file, but that's not so bad.) (Note - these are included in the <tt>ignorelist.cfg</tt>
file in the standard build). <br>
This feature can be used by Pester too, e.g. to ignore python comments
the <tt>ignorelist.cfg</tt> file would contain:
<pre>%#%\n<br></pre>
Note - the standard build also includes the line <tt>%//stopJesting%//resumeJesting</tt>
so that you can easily tell Jester to ignore parts if a source file if
it is causing problems for Jester. i.e. put a comment <tt>//stopJesting</tt>
on the line before the code you want Jester to ignore and <tt>//resumeJesting</tt>
on the line after the code you want Jester to ignore.
<h2>Using ANT</h2>
Here is a code snippet for using Jester from ANT. 
It copies the source
file to a location where Jester can work - the tests are excluded for
performance reasons. The classpath isn't specified statically but with
the -cp parameter to Jester.<br>
<pre>&nbsp; &lt;target name="jester" depends=""&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;delete dir="${modifiedsrc}"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;copy todir="${modifiedsrc}"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;fileset dir="${src}"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;exclude name="**/*Test.java"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;exclude name="**/AllTests.java"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/fileset&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/copy&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;java classpath="${classpath}" classname="jester.TestTester"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;arg value="-cp=${classpath}"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;arg value="myproject.AllTests"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;arg value="${modifiedsrc}/myproject"/&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/java&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>
If you get the source tree from CVS, you can try <tt>ant "run functionaltests"</tt> for an example
of using ANT to run Jester. Have a look at Jester's <tt>build.xml</tt> to see how that works.

<h2> Known Problems:</h2>
If the code will not compile (either because of classes missing from
the class path before Jester tried to compile any classes, or as a
result of a change to a source file by Jester) then Jester might hang
indefinitely.
<p>This version of Jester will not run in VisualAge for Java (see <a
 href="http://jester.sourceforge.net">Jester web page</a> in case a new
version exists that does run in VAJ). </p>
<p> <b>NOTE</b> that this version of Jester <b>will not</b> work with
version 1.0 of Pester; a new version of Pester will be released that
will work with this version of Jester - check the <a
 href="http://jester.sourceforge.net">Jester web page</a> if you want to
see if there is a new version of Pester.</p>
<p>Jester can't seem to find it's config files when run from ANT - the default values usually mean that this isn't much of a problem though.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>For Jester Developers:</h2>
If you want to look at Jester's java source code it is included in your
"<tt>jester.zip</tt>" as a file called "<tt>source.jar</tt>". The
source for the python code are the <tt>.py</tt> files. To run Jester's
tests
<ul>
  <li>execute '<tt>runAllTests.bat</tt>', and the PyUnit and JUnit
tests for Jester should run with no errors. <b>Note that these tests
need Python 2.2, JUnit 3.7/3.8.1 and the <a
 href="http://www.mockobjects.com">MockObjects</a> framework</b> - Jester
itself will run with other versions of JUnit &gt;= 3.2 and doesn't need
the <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com">MockObjects</a> framework to
run (Some test code was generated automatically using <a
 href="http://mockmaker.sourceforge.net">MockMaker</a>). (BTW - the
tests are not complete - see <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net">Jester
web page</a> for details). The <a
 href="http://mockmaker.sourceforge.net">MockMaker</a> modified <a
 href="http://www.mockobjects.com">MockObjects</a> runtime is included
as <tt>lib/mmmockobjects.jar</tt> under the relevant licenses (<a
 href="MockObjectsLicense.html">MockObjects license</a> and <a
 href="MockMakerLicense.html">MockMaker license</a>), hence: This
product includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation
(http://www.apache.org/). and the JUnit runtime is included as <tt>lib/junit.jar</tt>
under it's <a href="JUNITLICENSE.htm">license</a>. </li>

<h2> Support:</h2>
Please check the <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net">Jester web pages</a>
(hosted by <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a>) for
updates and the FAQs, and please enter comments or bug reports on the
appropriate pages linked from there.
<h3>If it doesn't work</h3>
The file "<tt>jester.log</tt>" (in the directory where you ran jester)
shows the commands that Jester has tried to run. In many cases, you can
work out what is wrong by trying to run the last command that Jester
tried to run. E.g. if the last line of the "<tt>jester.log</tt>" says "<tt>Sat
Dec 01 21:46:36 PST 2001 Trying to run command "java
jester.TestRunnerImpl jester.functionaltests.TestAll"</tt>", then try
running "<tt>java jester.TestRunnerImpl jester.functionaltests.TestAll</tt>";
this may then reveal the problem. In the case of tests not passing
(e.g. the message "Couldn't run test tester because tests didn't pass
before any changes made"), try running the tests both directly (e.g. "<tt>java
jester.functionaltests.TestAll</tt>") and using the command that Jester
uses (e.g.  "<tt>java jester.TestRunnerImpl
jester.functionaltests.TestAll</tt>"). Please delete the file "<tt>jester.log</tt>"
whenever it gets too large, or before running Jester if preferred.
