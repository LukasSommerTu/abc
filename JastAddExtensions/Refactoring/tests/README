About the Tests:
================

The tests are slowly being converted to JUnit tests. If you want to run a test, go to subdirectory 'data' and execute

  java -cp ../..:../../tools/junit.jar junit.textui.TestRunner tests.<TestName>

where TestName is one of the following (alternatively, just say 'runtest.sh <TestName>' in this directory):

- AccessPackageTests: test aspect AccessPackage
- AccessTypeTests: test aspect AccessType
- AccessFieldTests: test aspect AccessField
- AccessTests: all of the above three
- RenameFieldTests: test aspect RenameField
- RenameMethodTests: test aspect RenameMethod
- RenameTypeTests: test aspect RenameType
- RenameTests: all of the above three
- EncapsulationTests: test field encapsulation
- ExtractionTests: test method extraction
- AllTests: all of the above

NOTE: At the moment, only the AccessPackage tests are implemented in the
      recommended one-class-per-testcase style. For the other tests, all
      test cases are lumped together into one big test.
