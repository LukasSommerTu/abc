Running Tests from Command Line:
================================

If you want to run a test, go to subdirectory 'data' and execute

  java -cp ../..:../../tools/junit.jar junit.textui.TestRunner tests.<TestName>

where TestName is one of the following (alternatively, just say 'runtest.sh <TestName>' in this directory):

- AccessPackageTests: test aspect AccessPackage
- AccessTypeTests: test aspect AccessType
- AccessFieldTests: test aspect AccessField
- AccessTests: all of the above three
- RenameFieldTests: test aspect RenameField
- RenameMethodTests: test aspect RenameMethod
- RenameTypeTests: test aspect RenameType
- RenameTests: all of the above three
- EncapsulationTests: test field encapsulation
- ExtractionTests: test method extraction
- AllTests: all of the above

NOTE: At the moment, only the AccessPackage tests are implemented in the
      recommended one-class-per-testcase style. For the other tests, all
      test cases are lumped together into one big test.

Running Tests from Eclipse:
===========================

From the menu "Run", select "Run...". Double click on "JUnit" to create a
new JUnit test. Fill in its name (for example "Rename Type") and its test class
(for example "tests.RenameTypeTests"). Then, in the "Arguments" section, set
its working directory to "Other" and enter 
"${workspace_loc:Refactoring}/tests/data" into the text field. Now click "Apply"
and "Run".
