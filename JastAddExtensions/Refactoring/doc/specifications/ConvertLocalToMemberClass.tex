\subsection{\refactoring{Convert Local to Member Class}}
This refactoring converts a local class to a member class. Implemented in \sourcelink{TypePromotion/LocalClassToMemberClass.jrag}.

\begin{algorithm}

\STATE $h \leftarrow \util{enclosingType}(L)$

\end{algorithm}

We start by computing the enclosing type $h$ of $L$, into which we want to eventually insert $L$ as a member type. Then we close $L$ over type variables and local variables from the enclosing body declaration.

The utility function $\util{closeOverTypeVariables}(L)$ collects all type variables $V$ of the enclosing body declaration of $L$ which are used inside $L$. Every such $L$ is added as a type parameter to $L$, and every use of $L$ is augmented by a corresponding type access.

Similarly, $\util{closeOverLocalVariables}(L)$ adds a field $f_v$ to $L$ for every local variable $v$ of the enclosing body declaration of $L$. All uses of $v$ from within $L$ are replaced by locked accesses to $f_v$, and the constructors and instantiations of $L$ are adjusted to initialise $f_v$ to the value of $v$.

If $L$ is in a static context (for example because its enclosing body declaration is static), a \code{static} qualifier is added. All references to types with the same name as $L$ throughout the program are locked; likewise, all names within $L$ are locked. Then $L$ is removed from its enclosing body declaration and inserted as a member type into $h$.
