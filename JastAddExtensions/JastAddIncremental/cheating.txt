At the moment, there are three tweaks that have to be done manually to get JastAddJ to compile and behave sensibly:

1. In ASTNode.getParent(), comment out the if-statement incrementing the
   boundariesCrossed counter.
2. In TypeDecl.flushCache(), comment out the statement 
     this.arrayType$computed = false;
3. In CompilationUnit.java, fix the two "unknown()" calls: they should
   be calls to "invalidate()".

Also, you need to put the files in extras/ into your JastAdd directory (overwriting the corresponding versions there).
