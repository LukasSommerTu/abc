Module versioning as currently implemented in existing module systems such as
OSGi bundles and .net assemblies for Java-like languages depend on a flat
constraint system that for the most part uses only the version number to
determine compatibility. Current module systems now in use also lack the
capability to deliver patches to assemblies without redeploying the entire module or modifying the module destructively by unpacking the existing module and 
repackaging it with the patch changes. Other issues such as split Java packages
(packages that are present in more than one module) are present in OSGi
bundles, which can cause runtime exceptions that are difficult to diagnose and
debug. This paper proposes a novel module system which address these issues. The module system itself is derived from features present in object-oriented languages, and an implementation of the module system on Java as well as
a small case study is provided. The module system is compared to OSGi bundles,
a module system for Java in widespread use, and a translation from OSGi bundles
to modules in the proposed system is implemented to demonstrate that the module
system can express the constraints specified in OSGi bundles while allowing new
functionality such as patching through module extension.
