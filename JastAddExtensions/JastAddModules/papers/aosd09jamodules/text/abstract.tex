The aspect-oriented JastAdd compiler framework allows for
compilers that are easy to extend, but composition of language
modules can be difficult due to the lack of a module system.
We introduce a module system for JastAdd that allows the explicit
definition of language module dependencies, module instantiation and extension, 
and better information hiding. The module system is evaluated 
on a Java compiler written in JastAdd, where it has exposed
existing implicit dependencies, and allowed for explicit
module composition. We also speculate on how the module system
can benefit other aspect-oriented languages.
