We have presented a module system that improves extensibility and
information hiding when using ITDs. Instantiation enables multiple
variants of a base system, each with its own set of applied ITDs. Imports
and exports enable better support for access control improving information
hiding. An important consequence of these features is that they remove some
deficiencies of using plain ITDs compared to a visitor based solution.

The module system has been implemented as an extension to the JastAdd
system, an aspect-oriented attribute grammar extension to Java, which
supports ITDs as one of its major modularisation mechanisms. The solution
is purely compile-time and generates class files that can be executed on
a traditional JVM without explicit support for modules.

To evaluate the module system on a realistic system we retrofitted the
JastAdd Extensible Java Compiler (JastAddJ) to use modules. It is a
medium sized application of more than 21.000 lines of code which is
designed using the somewhat extreme viewpoint that the class hierarchy does
not contain any behaviour but rather added using ITDs. Minor changes to the
implementation enabled us to create a family of compilers that can coexist in the
same system using modules rather than ugly build file hacks. Moreover, it
enabled us to limit the scope of many properties that were gloabl in the
original implementation.

As future work we will experiment with using the module instantiation
features to further enahance the reuse of . E.g., instantiate and refine a
subcomponent within a single compiler rather than only across tool
boundaries.
