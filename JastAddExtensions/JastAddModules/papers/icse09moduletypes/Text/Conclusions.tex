The module type system models the common operations
in current use on Java modules, and allows the definition of constraints
not previously possible. It also provides a fine-grained
method of picking the class from the exact module from which
it is to be loaded by the use of module qualifiers. We have
also provided an implementation to demonstrate that it is
possible to realize this type system in an actual Java compiler.
We believe that the system provides a good conceptual
model for thinking about modules in Java and similar languages,
and that the new features allowed by the type system are worthy
of addition to any module system for Java-like languages.
