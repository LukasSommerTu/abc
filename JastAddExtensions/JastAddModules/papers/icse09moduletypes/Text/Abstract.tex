Module systems for handling collections of classes have been
traditionally based on a container with meta-data such
as versions, imports and exports. We present a different perspective
on modules by treating them as object-oriented types for class 
collections, and (non-formally) define relations and operations on these types. 
We demonstrate that these model common module operations and constraints 
now in use while adding the ability to express new constraints not previously
possible, and show novel usage of language features that are inspired by the
type system. The type system itself is implemented in a module-enabled
compiler for Java using JastAdd, an aspect-oriented compiler framework, and
is demonstrated on a small case study on JHotdraw 1.7.
